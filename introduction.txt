functional programming was introduced in java-8 which allows 
methods to be independent. This independent methods are called functions.
Functional programming allows these functions to run the block of code 
without associated with any class.

Lambdas - They are blocks of code used to implement the method defined by the 
functional interface (An interface with only one method).
